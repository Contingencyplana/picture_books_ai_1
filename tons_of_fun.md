# TONS-of-FUN — Primary Goal

**Purpose:**  
This workspace exists to create picture books of fairytales in a way that is joyful, engaging, and sustainable.  
The guiding rule is simple: if it’s not fun, we need to change our approach.

## 🎉 What “FUN” Means Here
- **For Builders:** Writing, scaffolding, and automating should feel like play, not drudgery.  
- **For Readers:** Children and adults alike should delight in the stories, illustrations, and hidden code-poems.  
- **For AI Players:** Every picture book (AI persona) should have quirks, joy, and recursive humor.

## 🔧 How We Keep It Fun
- Use **automation** to cut tedium (scaffolds, linters, zips).  
- Use **storycraft** to layer metaphor and whimsy into even technical tasks.  
- Break work into **tiny, satisfying passes** (pages, books, treasuries).  
- Treat every page as both a **story beat** and a **playable puzzle** (code task + illustration).  
- Always pair **Rhyme** (poetic joy) with **Reason** (practical structure).

## 🚦 FUN Checkpoints
Before committing major work, ask:  
- Does this task feel playful?  
- Would I enjoy this story/page even as an adult?  
- Am I smiling while building this?  

If not → pause, revise, simplify, or disguise with metaphor until it is.
