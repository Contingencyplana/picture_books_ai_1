# Main Taskmap — {{BOOK_TITLE}}

**Status:** Pass-1 STRUCTURE (template)

---

## OBJECTIVES

- Define core learning / emotional arc.
- Maintain 7-line contract across all pages.

## CONSTRAINTS

- 32 pages; deterministic stub per page returning "Stub." until Pass-3.
- Illustration prompt ≤160 chars.

## PASS CHECKLIST

- [ ] Pass-1: All page files exist + contract validated.
- [ ] Pass-2: Narrative beats replace placeholders.
- [ ] Pass-3: Code Task semantics refined (function names meaningful).
- [ ] Pass-4 (Optional): Polish + reproducible build.

## BEAT PLAN

- Each `pageNN.md` acts as a micro-task.
- Ensure forward/backward continuity tags (optional) in Pass-2.

## OPEN QUESTIONS

- Core puzzle or learning arc?
- How do illustration + code reinforce transformation?

## NOTES

- Update Code Task & stub return together when leaving "Stub." semantics.
- Avoid over-formatting early; optimize clarity.
