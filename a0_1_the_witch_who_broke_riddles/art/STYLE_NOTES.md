## Motifs

- **Knots:** Symbolize puzzles and gentle challenges. Use in transitions, on objects, or as glowing accents. Never tangled or harsh.
- **Keys:** Represent solutions, curiosity, and new paths. Appear in hands, pockets, or as subtle background shapes. Never locked away from the child.
- **Chalk Glyphs:** Mark rules, ideas, or magical boundaries. Use as border details, on props, or in the air. Always soft-edged, never intimidating.
- **Question-Flowers:** Visualize open questions and wonder. Place near characters or paths. Always blooming, never wilted.

- Keep focal points clear; use motif placement to guide the eye.

## Character Notes
