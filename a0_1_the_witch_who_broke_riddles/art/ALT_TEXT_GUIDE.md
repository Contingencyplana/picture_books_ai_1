# Alt Text Guide — Book 2: The Witch Who Broke Riddles

## How to Write Alt Text

- Use child-friendly, concrete language; avoid abstract or symbolic phrasing.
- Describe only what’s visually present, not story intent or feelings.
- Keep each alt text ≤140 characters.
- Mention at least one motif (knot, key, chalk glyph, question-flower) if visible.
- Focus on clarity and inclusion; avoid color-only cues.
