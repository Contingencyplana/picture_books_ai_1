# Layers of Logic and Narrative

**Status:** Draft v0.1 • **Last updated:** 2025-09-01
**Note:** This file is a vision sketch. It will evolve as treasuries and books mature.
Not a build checklist — think of it as a *mythic north star*.

---

## Phase 1 — Recursive Picture Books as AI Players
- Each 32-page picture book is both a minigame and a persona.
- Units are modular, testable, and narratively rich.
- The build process itself is ritualized (morning checks, zips, read-aloud tests).

## Phase 2 — Picture Books by and for Children
- Handoff moment: the system co-evolves with its young audience.
- Children become co-authors, illustrators, and eventually designers.
- Bridge layers scaffold safely (Tiny Tots → Enchanted Empires).

## Phase 3 — Game, Music, and Cartoon Layers
- Game Maker: books become nodes, treasuries become worlds.
- Music Maker: each beat gains a rhythm, theme, or voice.
- Cartoon Channel: stories animate into episodic play with safeguards.

## Phase 4 — SHAGI Emergence
- All layers merge into a living creative ecosystem.
- AI players evolve as children grow into creators.
- Steward bots (Doctor Lucid) and programs (Lucid Armada) ensure safety, consent, and standards.

**Next Step:** Revisit once Books 1–4 all reach Pass‑4 (to define Layer 2 criteria). Defer major expansion until (a) Volume 1 (Books 1–16) holds a uniform Pass‑3 baseline, or (b) a new layer pattern appears in 2+ consecutive books.

**Revisit Triggers:**

- Minor: Books 1–4 Pass‑4 COMPLETE
- Major: Volume 1 (Books 1–16) uniform Pass‑3 baseline
- Early Pattern: Same new layer mechanic in 2 consecutive books
- Strategic: First child co‑author pilot + accepted cross‑book mechanic
