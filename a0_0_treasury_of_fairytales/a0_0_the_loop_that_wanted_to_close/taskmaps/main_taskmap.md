## ðŸ“š Pages (Current Progress: 01â€“08 seeded)

1. **p01** â€” Child finds silver loop; it refuses to close.  
   - Code: `attempt_close(loop)` â†’ fragmented  
   - Illustration: glowing loop in moss

2. **p02** â€” Loop hums when child walks slowly.  
   - Code: `listen_to(loop.song)` â†’ incomplete melody  
   - Illustration: forest path, child holding loop

3. **p03** â€” Hollow tree with circle-shaped heart.  
   - Code: `fit(loop, hollow_tree)` â†’ shape mismatch  
   - Illustration: hollow tree opening

4. **p04** â€” Loop shatters into fragments, whispers softly.  
   - Code: `reassemble(loop.fragments)` â†’ fragile  
   - Illustration: glowing fragments in tree

5. **p05** â€” [Seeded: child follows fragment whispers deeper...]  
6. **p06** â€” [Seeded: loop-song changes tone...]  
7. **p07** â€” [Seeded: first hint of kindness mechanic...]  
8. **p08** â€” [Seeded: fragments begin to align...]
