## ✅ Status (Pass 4 complete)

- Pages 01–32 present and narrative written.
- `// Code Task:` lines normalized (→ RESULT: "…").
- Python stubs inserted beneath every Code Task; harness passes.
- Linter clean for titles, code tasks (presence), and illustrations.
- `ai_player.json` present for this book.
- Zips reproducible; rotation policy “latest + 1 timestamp” enforced; SHA256 summary shown.
