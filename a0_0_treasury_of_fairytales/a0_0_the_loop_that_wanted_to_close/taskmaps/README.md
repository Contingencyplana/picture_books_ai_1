## ðŸ“– Synopsis (WIP)
A child discovers a silver loop that longs to close but resists easy answers.  
Through patience, kindness, and recursive attempts, the child learns that loops  
only close when treated with care.

## ðŸ§­ Guidance
- Each page = **micro-beat**: story line(s) + code task + illustration prompt.
- Track progress in `main_taskmap.md` and `milestones.md`.
- Update synopsis here as the book evolves.
