# Taskmaps â€” Book 1: *The Loop That Wanted to Close*

**Purpose:** Track narrative beats, code subtasks, and milestones for this AI Player.
Book 1 serves as the **foundational metaphor** for the Treasury of Fairytales series.

---

## ðŸ“– Synopsis (WIP)
A child discovers a silver loop that longs to close but resists easy answers.
Through patience, kindness, and recursive attempts, the child learns that loops
only close when treated with care.

---

## ðŸ§­ Guidance
- Each page = **micro-beat**: story line(s) + code task + illustration prompt.
- Track progress in `main_taskmap.md` and `milestones.md`.
- Update synopsis here as the book evolves.

---

## âœ… Current Status
- **Pass 1 â€” Scaffold:** complete (32 pages + stubs present).
- **Pass 2 â€” Narrative:** complete (story lines, code tasks, illustrations).
- **Pass 3 â€” Code:** pseudo-code stubs documented.
- **Pass 4 â€” Validation / Play:** âœ… done
  - Lint + stub checker clean.
  - `ai_player.json` present, schema-valid.
  - Zip pipeline enforces *latest + one timestamp*, with checksums.
- Next passes (optional): Art, Export, Gameplay.

## ðŸ“‚ Key Files
- `ai_player.json` â†’ defines this AI Player (id, title, path, pages, principles).
- `taskmaps/main_taskmap.md` â†’ sequential map of pages.
- `taskmaps/milestones.md` â†’ pagestanza + pass tracking.
- Zips in `/dist/` â†’ reproducible builds (`_clean_latest.zip` + one timestamped).

---

## ðŸ”® Next Steps
- Draft **STYLE_NOTES.md** for illustration motifs (Pass 5).
- Add export pipeline for previews (Pass 6).
- Link page stubs to interactive node logic (Pass 7).
