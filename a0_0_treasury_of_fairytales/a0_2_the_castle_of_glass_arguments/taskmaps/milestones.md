# Milestones — Book 3

- **2025-09-01** — Pass-3 COMPLETE (P01–P32)
  - Deterministic Python stubs; 4-space indents; `[python]` fences; 7-line contract.
  - Tests + lint + build green; two-zip rotation updated.

- **NEXT (Pass-4 IN PROGRESS)** — Reproducible zips + light polish
  - Ensure two most recent ZIP hashes logged to `fluff_inventory.md`.
  - Update release notes with tag + primary ZIP SHA.
  - Optional: tighten illustration phrasing; micro cadence edits (no contract drift).

- **FUTURE (Optional)** — Art Pass v0 (if scheduled after Pass-4)
