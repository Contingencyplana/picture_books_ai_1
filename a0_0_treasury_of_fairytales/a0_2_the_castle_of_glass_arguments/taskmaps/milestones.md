# Milestones — Book 3

- **2025-09-01** — Pass-3 COMPLETE (P01–P32)
  - Deterministic Python stubs; 4-space indents; `[python]` fences; 7-line contract.
  - P01–P32 contract-clean; lint/stub/build green; two-zip rotation confirmed.

- **OPTIONAL (Pass-4 TBD)** — Reproducible zips + light polish (only if scheduled)
  - Would ensure two most recent ZIP hashes logged to `fluff_inventory.md`.
  - Would add release notes with tag + primary ZIP SHA.
  - Optional polish: tighten illustration phrasing; micro cadence edits (no contract drift).

- **FUTURE (Optional)** — Art Pass v0 (if scheduled after any Pass-4)
