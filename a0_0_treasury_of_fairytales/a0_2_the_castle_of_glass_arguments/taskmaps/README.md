# Taskmaps â€” Book 3: *The Castle of Glass Arguments*

**Purpose:** Track narrative beats, code subtasks, and milestones for this AI Player.
Book 3 explores fragile arguments and reflections â€” glass-like logic that can shatter under pressure.

---

## ðŸ“– Synopsis (WIP)

In a castle made of glass, every argument echoes and refracts.
The child learns that brittle logic breaks, but questions asked with care can reveal clarity.

---

## ðŸ§­ Guidance

- Each page = **micro-beat**: story line(s) + code task + illustration prompt.
- Track pagestanza progress in `main_taskmap.md`.
- Track page + pass completion in `milestones.md`.
- Keep Pass 1 minimal; add narrative in Pass 2.
- Re-run validation scripts before marking Pass 4 complete.

---

## âœ… Current Status

- **Pass 1 â€” Scaffold:** complete (32 pages present, stubs deterministic).
- **Pass 2 â€” Narrative:** not yet started (TBD placeholders).
- **Pass 3 â€” Code/Schema:** pending.
- **Pass 4 â€” Validation/Play:** pending.
- Optional passes: Art, Export, Gameplay.

## ðŸ“‚ Key Files

- `ai_player.json` â†’ defines this AI Player (id, title, path, pages, principles)
- `taskmaps/main_taskmap.md` â†’ pagestanzas + beats (TBD in Pass 2)
- `taskmaps/milestones.md` â†’ page + pass tracking (scaffold vs narrative)
- Zips in `/dist/` â†’ reproducible builds (`_clean_latest.zip` + one timestamped)

---

## ðŸ”® Next Steps

- Begin **Pass-2 Narrative**: replace placeholders with glass-castle arc beats.
- Plan **Pass-3 Code/Schema** alignment once narrative stable.
