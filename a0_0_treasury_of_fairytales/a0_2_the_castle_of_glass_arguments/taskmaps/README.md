# Book 3 — Taskmaps (The Castle of Glass Arguments)

**Status:** Pass-3 COMPLETE; Pass-4 OPTIONAL/TBD • **Owner:** Mark R. Gillam • **Last updated:** 2025-09-01
**Purpose:** Planning and audit trail for Book 3 work. Mirrors code reality (pages, tests, zips).

---

## CONTEXT

- Pages (P01–P32) conform to the **7-line page contract**:
  - H1 page title; 1–2 story lines; `// Code Task: …`; `[python]` deterministic stub (4-space indents, no tabs); single `[Illustration: …]` ≤160 chars; UTF-8 + LF; one blank after H1.
- P01–P32 contract-clean; lint/stub/build green; zips confirmed (two-zip rotation).

## NEXT (Pass-4 Optional/TBD)

- If scheduled: light polish (illustration phrasing, cadence) without breaking contract.
- If executed: verify latest two ZIP hashes logged (`fluff_inventory.md`), add release notes entry/tag, confirm reproducible hash stability.

## UPCOMING (Optional)

- Art Pass v0 (style notes + alt-text guide) — only after any Pass-4 polish.
