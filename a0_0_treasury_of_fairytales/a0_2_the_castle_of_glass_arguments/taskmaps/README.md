# Taskmaps — Book 3: *The Castle of Glass Arguments*

**Purpose:** Track narrative beats, code subtasks, and milestones for this AI Player.
Book 3 explores fragile arguments and reflections — glass-like logic that can shatter under pressure.

---

## 📖 Synopsis (WIP)
In a castle made of glass, every argument echoes and refracts.
The child learns that brittle logic breaks, but questions asked with care can reveal clarity.

---

## 🧭 Guidance
- Each page = **micro-beat**: story line(s) + code task + illustration prompt.
- Track progress in `main_taskmap.md` (pagestanzas).
- Track checkboxes in `milestones.md`.
- Update synopsis here as the book evolves.

---

## ✅ Current Status
- **Pass-1 — Scaffold:** complete (32 pages present, stubs deterministic).
- **Pass-2 — Narrative:** not yet started (TBD placeholders).
- **Pass-3 — Code/Schema:** pending.
- **Pass-4 — Validation/Play:** pending.
- Optional passes: Art, Export, Gameplay.

## 📂 Key Files
- `ai_player.json` → defines this AI Player (id, title, path, pages, principles).
- `taskmaps/main_taskmap.md` → sequential map of pages.
- `taskmaps/milestones.md` → pagestanza + pass tracking.
- Zips in `/dist/` → reproducible builds (`_clean_latest.zip` + one timestamped).

---

## 🔮 Next Steps
- Begin **Pass-2 Narrative**: replace placeholders with glass-castle arc beats.
- Plan **Pass-3 Code/Schema** alignment once narrative stable.
