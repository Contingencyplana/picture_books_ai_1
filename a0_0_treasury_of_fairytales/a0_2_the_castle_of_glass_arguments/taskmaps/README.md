# Book 3 — Taskmaps (The Castle of Glass Arguments)

**Status:** Pass-3 COMPLETE; Pass-4 IN PROGRESS • **Owner:** Mark R. Gillam • **Last updated:** 2025-09-01
**Purpose:** Planning and audit trail for Book 3 work. Mirrors code reality (pages, tests, zips).

---

## CONTEXT

- Pages (P01–P32) conform to the **7-line page contract**:
  - H1 page title; 1–2 story lines; `// Code Task: …`; `[python]` deterministic stub (4-space indents, no tabs); single `[Illustration: …]` ≤160 chars; UTF-8 + LF; one blank after H1.
- Build discipline: two-zip rotation; reproducible zips; stub + lint checks green.

## CURRENT FOCUS (Pass-4)

1. Verify latest two ZIP hashes logged (`fluff_inventory.md`).
2. Release notes entry + build tag (Book 3 Pass-3→4).
3. Light polish (illustration phrasing, cadence) without breaking contract.
4. Regenerate zips post-polish; confirm stable hashes.
5. Mark Pass-4 COMPLETE.

## UPCOMING (Optional)

- Art Pass v0 (style notes + alt-text guide) — schedule after Pass-4 completion.
