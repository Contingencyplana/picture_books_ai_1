# Treasury of Fairytales — Main Roadmap (16 Picture Books)

**Last updated:** 2025-09-01 • **Owner:** Mark R. Gillam
**Scope:** Series-level view across all 16 books. Roadstanza docs provide focused zoom-ins (4 books at a time).

---

## CONTEXT
- Canonical page contract: 7 lines (H1, 1–2 story lines, `// Code Task:`, `[python]` deterministic stub with 4-space indents, `[Illustration: …]` ≤160 chars, UTF-8/LF, one blank line after H1).
- Reproducible builds: two-zip rotation via `_scripts/make_zips.ps1`.
- Latest clean ZIP SHA256 (as of 2025-09-01 08:07:45):
  `E67BE51975A401A6F78096608C89164EB17A54F85FA645BEC3D0327552E51ED2`

## TASK AT HAND
- Keep this table aligned as books progress through Pass-3 (deterministic stubs) and optional Pass-4 (light polish).
- When a book finishes a pass: update **Status**, add a Milestone entry, and (optionally) tag a build + add to release notes.
