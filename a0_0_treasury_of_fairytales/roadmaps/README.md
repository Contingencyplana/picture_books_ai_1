# Roadmaps â€” Treasury of Fairytales

**Purpose:** Roadmaps provide *series-level planning* for the Treasury of Fairytales.
They differ from taskmaps, which track progress inside a single picture book.

---

## ðŸ§­ Structure

- Roadmaps are organized into **roadstanzas**.
  - Each roadstanza represents a series-level arc (e.g., the launch of a new set of books).
  - Within each roadstanza, individual books are logged as they pass their major passes.
- Roadmaps connect *downward* to:
  - **Book taskmaps** (`taskmaps/`) for detailed per-page tracking.
- Roadmaps connect *upward* to:
  - **Root-level milestones** (project-wide history).

## ðŸ“š Current Status

- **Roadstanza 0 â€” Foundations**
  - Book 1 (*The Loop That Wanted to Close*) is complete through **Pass 4 (Validation / Play)** (optional Art pass still open).
  - Book 2 (*The Witch who Broke Riddles*) is complete through **Pass 5 (Art v0.1)**.
  - Book 3 (*The Castle of Glass Arguments*) is complete through **Pass 3 (stubs P01â€“P32 contract-complete, lint/stub/build checks green)**; Pass 4 in progress.
  - Stable reproducible build process: lint + stub check + zip rotation (latest + one timestamped), SHA256 checksums verified.
  - Optional passes (Art, Export, Gameplay) remain available.

Future books will extend this roadmap into **Roadstanza 1, Roadstanza 2,** and beyond.
