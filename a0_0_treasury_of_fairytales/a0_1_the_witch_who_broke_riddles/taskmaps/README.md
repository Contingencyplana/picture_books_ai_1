# Taskmaps — Book 2: *The Witch Who Broke Riddles*

**Purpose:** Track narrative beats, code subtasks, and milestones for this AI Player.
Book 2 explores riddles, puzzles, and broken patterns that demand careful listening.

---

## 📖 Synopsis (WIP)

A witch’s riddles scatter across a kingdom; each one broken, misleading, or incomplete.
A child must learn to ask the right questions, gather fragments, and restore meaning.

---

## 🧭 Guidance

- Each page = **micro-beat**: story line(s) + code task + illustration prompt.
- Track pagestanza progress in `main_taskmap.md`.
- Track page + pass completion in `milestones.md`.
- Update synopsis here as the book evolves.

---

## ✅ Current Status

- **Pass 1 — Scaffold:** complete (32 pages present, stubs deterministic).
- **Pass 2 — Narrative:** not yet started (TBD placeholders).
- **Pass 3 — Code/Schema:** pending.
- **Pass 4 — Validation/Play:** pending.
- Optional passes: Art, Export, Gameplay.

## 📂 Key Files

- `ai_player.json` → defines this AI Player (id, title, path, pages, principles)
- `taskmaps/main_taskmap.md` → pagestanzas + beats
- `taskmaps/milestones.md` → page + pass tracking
- Zips in `/dist/` → reproducible builds (`_clean_latest.zip` + one timestamped)

---

## 🔮 Next Steps

- Begin **Pass 2 Narrative**: replace placeholders with riddle-arc beats.
- Plan **Pass 3 Code/Schema** alignment once narrative stable.
