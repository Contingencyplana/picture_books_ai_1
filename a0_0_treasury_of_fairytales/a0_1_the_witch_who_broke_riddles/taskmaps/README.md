# Taskmaps â€” Book 2: *The Witch Who Broke Riddles*

**Purpose:** Track narrative beats, code subtasks, and milestones for this AI Player.
Book 2 explores riddles, puzzles, and broken patterns that demand careful listening.

---

## ðŸ“– Synopsis (WIP)
A witchâ€™s riddles scatter across a kingdom; each one broken, misleading, or incomplete.
A child must learn to ask the right questions, gather fragments, and restore meaning.

---

## ðŸ§­ Guidance
- Each page = **micro-beat**: story line(s) + code task + illustration prompt.
- Track progress in `main_taskmap.md` (pagestanzas).
- Track checkboxes in `milestones.md`.
- Update synopsis here as the book evolves.

---

## âœ… Current Status
- **Pass-1 â€” Scaffold:** complete (32 pages present, stubs deterministic).
- **Pass-2 â€” Narrative:** not yet started (TBD placeholders).
- **Pass-3 â€” Code/Schema:** pending.
- **Pass-4 â€” Validation/Play:** pending.
- Optional passes: Art, Export, Gameplay.

## ðŸ“‚ Key Files
- `ai_player.json` â†’ defines this AI Player (id, title, path, pages, principles).
- `taskmaps/main_taskmap.md` â†’ sequential map of pages.
- `taskmaps/milestones.md` â†’ pagestanza + pass tracking.
- Zips in `/dist/` â†’ reproducible builds (`_clean_latest.zip` + one timestamped).

---

## ðŸ”® Next Steps
- Begin **Pass-2 Narrative**: replace placeholders with riddle-arc beats.
- Plan **Pass-3 Code/Schema** alignment once narrative stable.
