# a0_1 — The Witch Who Broke Riddles

**Series:** a0_0_treasury_of_fairytales
**Book ID:** a0_1_the_witch_who_broke_riddles
**Pages:** 32

## Purpose
A fairytale that flips the usual “gotcha” riddle into a game of kindness and curiosity. The witch breaks bad riddles so better ones can grow.

## One-sentence logline
A clever witch unknots trick riddles by changing the rules—and teaches a village how to ask questions that help.

## Audience & tone
Ages 5–8; playful, bright, a little mischievous; zero meanness.

## Themes
- Curiosity > trickery
- Empathy in puzzles
- Pattern-breaking and “rule repair”

## Art direction (scaffold)
- Style: painterly folk-tale with bold shapes; warm twilight palette.
- Motifs: knots, keys, chalk glyphs, question-flowers.
- Witch: kind, twinkly; not scary.
- Accessibility: large type, strong contrast.

1) Present a “bad” riddle (trick/mean/unsolvable)
2) Witch demonstrates a gentle “rule repair”
3) Child/player tries the repaired pattern
4) New riddle blooms (repeat with variation)
