# Taskmap — Book 4 (The Bridge of Kind Questions)

**Scope:** Track granular tasks for Book 4.
**Status:** Pass-1 STRUCTURE (scaffolding in progress).

---

## PASS-1 TODO (Pages P01–P32)
- [ ] Scaffold README.md
- [ ] Add `ai_player.json`
- [ ] Create page01.md … page32.md (7-line contract)
- [ ] Create taskmaps (this file + milestones + README)
- [ ] Verify no tabs / 4-space indents
- [ ] Ensure all stubs return "Stub." and match Code Task names
- [ ] Run stub & lint checks clean

## PIPELINE (Forward Look)
- Pass-1 Structure (current)
- Pass-2 Narrative alignment (up next)
- Pass-3 Code/Schema deterministic semantics
- Pass-4 Optional polish + reproducible builds

## OPTIONAL (Deferred Until After Pass-1)
- Add initial narrative arcs
- Establish illustration style constraints
- Introduce Code Task verb taxonomy
