# Book 4 — Taskmaps (The Bridge of Kind Questions)

**Status:** Pass-1 STRUCTURE (scaffolding) • **Pages:** 32
**Purpose:** Track Book 4 progress across build passes while mirroring code reality.

---

## PASS SCOPE
- Pass-1: Generate all 32 page scaffolds (7-line contract, deterministic stubs returning "Stub.").
- Pass-2: Replace placeholder story lines with cohesive narrative (curiosity & bridge motif).
- Pass-3: Refine Code Task semantics + ensure deterministic stub alignment.
- Pass-4 (Optional): Light polish (illustration phrasing, cadence) + reproducible build confirmation.

## CONTRACT REMINDERS
- H1 `# Page NN`, blank line after.
- 1–2 placeholder story lines (may be refined later).
- `// Code Task: func_name() → RESULT: "Stub."`
- `[python]` tag followed by stub: `def func_name():` returning "Stub." only.
- Single `[Illustration: …]` ≤160 chars.
- 4-space indent inside stub; no tabs; UTF-8 LF.

## SYNC NOTES
- Do not introduce narrative polish during Pass-1; keep scope tight.
- Deterministic stub values are frozen to "Stub." until Pass-3.
- If contract drift occurs, fix immediately before proceeding.
