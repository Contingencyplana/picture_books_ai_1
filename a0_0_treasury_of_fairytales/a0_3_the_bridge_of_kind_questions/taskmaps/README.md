# Taskmaps â€” Book 4: *The Bridge of Kind Questions*

**Purpose:** Track narrative beats, code subtasks, and milestones for this AI Player.

---

## ðŸ“– Synopsis (WIP)

A child approaches a bridge made not of stone, but of questions. Each careful question is a plank. Listening makes it strong.

---

## ðŸ§­ Guidance

- Each page = micro-beat: story line(s) + code task + illustration prompt.
- Use 8 Pagestanzas (4 pages each) in `main_taskmap.md`.
- Track page + pass completion in `milestones.md`.
- Narrative fills TBD placeholders in Pass 2.

---

## âœ… Pass Status

- Pass 1 â€” Scaffold: complete (32 pages + deterministic stubs)
- Pass 2 â€” Narrative: pending (placeholders intact)
- Pass 3 â€” Code/Schema: pending
- Pass 4 â€” Validation/Play: pending

---

## ðŸ“‚ Key Files

- `ai_player.json` â€” defines this AI Player (id, title, path, pages, principles)
- `taskmaps/main_taskmap.md` â€” Pagestanzas + placeholders
- `taskmaps/milestones.md` â€” page + pass tracking
- `dist/` â€” reproducible build zips
