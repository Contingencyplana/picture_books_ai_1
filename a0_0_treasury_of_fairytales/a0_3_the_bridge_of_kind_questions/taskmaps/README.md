# Taskmaps â€” Book 4: *The Bridge of Kind Questions*

**Purpose:** Track narrative beats, code subtasks, and milestones for this AI Player.
Book 4 closes **Roadstanza 0 â€” Foundations**, carrying a theme of bridges, curiosity, and gentle questions.

---

## ðŸ“– Synopsis (WIP)
A child approaches a bridge made not of stone, but of questions.
Each step forward requires asking â€” and listening kindly.
Through inquiry, they discover the bridge carries not just themselves, but others.

---

## ðŸ§­ Guidance
- Each page = **micro-beat**: story line(s) + code task + illustration prompt.
- Group progress into 8 **Pagestanzas** of 4 pages each.
- Track sequential beats in `main_taskmap.md`.
- Record completion in `milestones.md`.

---

## âœ… Current Status
- **Pass-1 â€” Scaffold:** complete (32 pages + stubs present).
- **Pass-2 â€” Narrative:** pending (placeholders to be replaced with curiosity/bridge theme).
- **Pass-3 â€” Code/Schema:** pending (refine Code Task verbs, align deterministic stubs).
- **Pass-4 â€” Validation/Play:** pending.

Optional future passes:
- Pass-5 Art: motifs, palettes.
- Pass-6 Export: preview formats.
- Pass-7 Gameplay: interactive mapping.

## ðŸ“‚ Key Files
- `ai_player.json` â†’ defines this AI Player (id, title, path, pages, principles).
- `taskmaps/main_taskmap.md` â†’ sequential map of pages (Pagestanzas).
- `taskmaps/milestones.md` â†’ Pagestanza + pass tracking.
- Zips in `/dist/` â†’ reproducible builds (`_clean_latest.zip` + one timestamped).

---

## ðŸ”® Next Steps
- Fill Pagestanza placeholders during Pass-2.
- Sync milestones checkboxes with narrative progress.
- Keep reproducible build pipeline green.
