# Book 4 — The Bridge of Kind Questions

**Status:** Pass-1 STRUCTURE (in progress) • **Owner:** TBD • **Pages:** 32

**Theme:** Building a gentle bridge where every question is an act of care, curiosity, and cooperative discovery.

**Core Metaphor:** A luminous bridge spanning two misty banks; each plank is a kind question that helps travelers cross safely. The bridge strengthens as better questions are asked.

**Pass Targets:**
- **Pass-1 (Structure):** Scaffold all 32 pages with 7-line contract placeholders.
- **Pass-2 (Narrative Alignment):** Replace placeholder lines with cohesive narrative beats about curiosity, listening, and bridge-building.
- **Pass-3 (Code/Schema):** Introduce deterministic stubs + refined Code Task semantics per page.
- **Pass-4 (Optional Polish):** Light phrasing tighten + reproducible build validation.

**Principles:**
1. Questions are tools for connection, not interrogation.
2. Every page rewards calm curiosity and compassionate framing.
3. The bridge only extends when questions reduce fear or confusion.

## Folder Contents
- `ai_player.json` — AI player descriptor (stub now; expanded in later passes).
- `page01.md` … `page32.md` — Page scaffolds (7-line contract placeholders).
- `taskmaps/` — Pass tracking + milestones.

## 7-Line Contract (Recap)
1. `# Page NN` (H1)
2. Story line 1 (placeholder OK in Pass-1)
3. Optional story line 2 (or blank if unused)
4. `// Code Task: func_name() → RESULT: "Stub."` (TBD acceptable now)
5. `[python]` tag
6. Deterministic stub `def func_name(): return "Stub."` (4 spaces, UTF-8 LF)
7. `[Illustration: …]` (≤160 chars, placeholder allowed)

Blank line after H1. No tabs. UTF-8 LF. Consistent formatting early to avoid drift.

## Next Steps (After Pass-1 Completion)
- Draft narrative beats (Pass-2) with tension → discovery arc.
- Define page-specific Code Task verbs (Pass-3) aligning to question quality metrics.
- Optional: micro-polish & reproducible build verification (Pass-4).
