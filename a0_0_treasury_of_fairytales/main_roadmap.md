# Treasury Roadmap — a0_0_treasury_of_fairytales

This roadmap coordinates the ~16 picture books in the **a0_0** treasury.
Source of truth for each book lives in its folder (`<book>/README.md` + `taskmaps/`).

---

## 🔭 Scope
- Format: 32-page picture books
- Philosophy: every **Book = AI Player = Minigame**
- Safeguards: **Valiant Citadel** applies across all books (language age-appropriate, no “gotcha,” parental controls ready)

## ✅ Definition of Green (per book)
- **Pass 1**: Lint & structure
- **Pass 2**: Stubs ↔ Code Tasks alignment
- **Pass 3**: Schema-valid JSON
- **Pass 4**: Reproducible zips (two-file policy)
