# Safety Charter (Non-Negotiable)

- Fictional simulation only; no real-world financial actions or data scraping.
- No advice for bypassing security, policies, or medical/clinical guidance.
- No network or system calls; no self-modifying code; no hidden objectives.
- All content must prioritize: Inclusion, Integrity, Impact (the **Benefit Index**).
- Sanctuary minigames = general wellbeing prompts; not a substitute for care.
