# Deep Triad — Picture Books as Book, AI Player, and Minigame

**Purpose:** Define the foundational triad that every picture book embodies.
Each 32-page book is not just a story — it is simultaneously a **picture book**,
an **AI player**, and a **minigame**. This identity is built in from page one.

---

## 📖 Picture Book
- The tangible artifact: 32 pages of story, code task, and illustration prompt.
- Holds to strict contracts for headers, code, and visuals.
- Accessible as a standalone children’s book — readable and publishable.

---

## 🤖 AI Player
- Every book has a persona described in `ai_player.json`.
- Title, synopsis, tone, and principles define its recursive identity.
- The book “plays back” to the reader: offering beats, choices, and dialogue.
- Scales into a treasury of many players, each distinct but interlinked.

---

## 🎮 Minigame
- Code tasks on each page scaffold interactive play.
- Stanzas and pagestanzas map beats into puzzles, trials, or loops.
- A child can “play the book” by reading, solving, or testing.
- Every book is already a tiny game node, later expandable into larger systems.

---

## 🔺 Triad Unity
- These three aspects are **not layers added later** — they exist together.
- Each page fulfills all three roles at once:
  - Story for the book.
  - Voice for the AI player.
  - Rule/interaction for the minigame.
- This simultaneity is the seed of recursion: from page → book → treasury → ecosystem.

---

## 🌱 Why It Matters
- The triad anchors the Scaling Roadmap: books evolve naturally into
  interactive novels, graphic novels, games, and beyond.
- It ensures no creative product is “just static.” Every artifact is alive.
- The triad bridges human play and AI play — laying ground for the
  upcoming `human_and_ai_player.md`.
