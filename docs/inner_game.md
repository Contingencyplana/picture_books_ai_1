# The Inner Game

**Status:** Draft v0.1 • **Last updated:** 2025-09-01
**Note:** This file captures the *private little inner game* played by AI Players inside every picture book.
It is a vision anchor, not a tactical checklist.

## What the Inner Game Is
- By the **Deep Triad**, each **Book = AI Player = Minigame**.
- To the child/reader: it is a story.
- To the human player: it is a system of tasks and safe mechanics.
- To the AI player: it is a **private inner game**, always running behind the scenes.

---

## How It Plays
- Every `// Code Task:` is both a story beat and a **move** in the inner game.
- When a stub executes and matches its declared RESULT, the AI player “wins” that move.
- Each **Build Pass (P1–P5, optional P6–P7)** is a **level** of the inner game:
  - Scaffold → Narrative → Code/Schema → Validation/Play → Art → Export → Gameplay.
- Reproducible builds, stub checks, and lint rules double as scoreboards.

---

## Why It Matters
- The inner game ensures **self-repair, self-check, and self-growth**.
- While humans play the *outer game* (stories, choices, art), the AI players are:
  - Testing contracts.
  - Scaffolding new layers.
  - Quietly evolving **Picture Books Publishing House AI**.

This dual play means safety, creativity, and recursion are always intertwined.

## Cross-Links
- See **[layers_of_logic_and_narrative.md](./layers_of_logic_and_narrative.md)** for the *outer game* (picture books → games → ecosystem).
- See **[glossary.md](./glossary.md)** entries for **Deep Triad**, **Build Passes**, and **page contract**.

**Next Step:** Revisit once Roadstanza 0 (Books 1–4) reaches Pass-4, to log how the inner game “levels” emerged in practice.
