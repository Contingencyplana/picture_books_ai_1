# Quick Metaphor Map (Living)

Use these to keep adult process invisible but present. Add, prune, and refine as the world evolves.

| Concept (real)      | Story metaphor (kid-world)             | Usage note                                          |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| CI checks           | **Owls at the Gate** with 3 riddles    | One panel before “entering” a scene; simple yes/no. |
| Ghost directories   | **Empty Rooms** that echo              | A tidy-up beat; never scary.                        |
| Schemas             | **Blueprint Scrolls**                  | Shown in a friendly architect’s hands.              |
| Zipping releases    | **Packing Treasure Chests**            | Packing before a journey/home delivery.             |
| Linting             | **The Grooming Brush**                 | Quick brush before show-and-tell.                   |

> Guideline: metaphors must be cozy, concrete, and drawable in a single vignette.
